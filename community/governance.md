## DAO Structure

### Overview
The Knot Riddles DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) empowers community members to participate in platform governance and decision-making processes.

### Voting System

#### 1. Proposal Mechanism
```solidity
contract KnotRiddlesDAO {
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 id;
        string description;
        uint256 forVotes;
        uint256 againstVotes;
        uint256 startTime;
        uint256 endTime;
        bool executed;
        mapping(address => bool) hasVoted;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    
    function createProposal(
        string memory description,
        uint256 duration
    ) public returns (uint256) {
        // Proposal creation logic
    }
    
    function vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) public {
        // Voting logic
    }
}
```

#### 2. Voting Power
- Token-based voting
- Participation metrics
- Time-weighted voting
- Reputation system
